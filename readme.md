#Sunnyside agency landing page solution using just html and css...

|This design was done with the little css knowledge i have acquired so far...|


|The solution to this design is being centered on positioning and display flex in which it allow one to have deeper understanding about display flex and positioning. I couldnt make my MENU the way it was on the original design simply bcos i used just HTML $ CSS only for this design but I know with a lot of practices, I will get the best out of my frontend skills by moving on to the next chapter after two or three more practices of design based on html css...|

|Feedbacks are appreciated...
Thanks|
